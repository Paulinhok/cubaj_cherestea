    "infoPage": "Information Page",
    "infoContent": "The Timber Volume Application is designed for calculating the volume in cubic meters of dimensioned working wood, such as boards, planks, beams, or squares.",
    "infoContent2": "What is a cubic meter?",
    "infoContent3": "The cubic meter is one of ",
    "infoContent4": "the standardized units of measurement, ",
    "infoContent5": "used in a variety of fields, but most often in the construction sector. The cubic meter, denoted in the International System (SI) as mc or m³, is a unit of volume measurement.",
    "infoContent6": "How is the cubic meter calculated?",
    "infoContent7": "The cubic meter is calculated by considering the magnitude of three dimensions, namely length, width, and height. For better understanding, we can think of a box with a side of 1 meter, a cube, whose three dimensions we will multiply: length of 1 m, width of 1 m, and height also of 1 m. Thus, we will obtain a cubic meter, which represents the volume of the cube or box.",
    "infoContent8": "Cubic meter formula",
    "infoContent9": "To calculate 1 cubic meter of a material (using the volume calculation formula), it is necessary to know the exact, measured dimensions of the elements that constitute the volume. Thus, the general formula by which a cubic meter can be calculated is:",
    "infoContent10": "Volume = Length (meters) x Width (meters) x Height (meters)",
    "infoContent11": "The resulting value represents the volume in cubic meters, but it should be noted that not every time will we have clear, linear values to measure.\nIn some situations, approximations (meter measurement units) may be needed because on some sides there may be obstacles that need to be considered.\nFor example, if you want to calculate how many cubic meters are on a pallet of boards, here are the calculations you need to make:",
    "infoContent12": "Length = 4.5 m;\nWidth = 0.9 m;\nHeight = 0.8 m;\nVolume of the timber pallet = 4.5 m x 0.9 m x 0.8 m = 3.24 m³",
